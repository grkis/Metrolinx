                <h1 class="storymapH1"> Utilization of StoryMaps to highlight highly vulnerable areas </h1> 
		    <p class="storymapfont"> StoryMap is an exceptional tool for integrating web maps and text to develop a captivating narrative. In this project, ESRI's StoryMap was utilized to spotlight the stations that are most susceptible to climate change. The interactive legend skillfully directs the user's attention to specific areas on the map that Metrolinx is particularly concerned about. </p>
		    <p class="storymapfont"> It is also an excellent platform for combining multiple AGOL products. In this project, both ArcGIS Online Web Map and Experience Builder were effectively deployed, leveraging the strengths of each tool. StoryMaps empowers the publisher to guide the reader through the data in a specific way, allowing them to narrate the information as intended. We found that StoryMap is a great tool for displaying complex/convoluted data and effectively directing the user's attention to specific ideas.  </p>
            <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4361d4a3d1424b6f8e116a7d0c1d65b6" class="buttonlink">See StoryMap</a>
		<h1 class="storymapH1"> Key attributes of our StoryMap </h1>
		    <h2 class="storymapH2"> Interactive popup and legend </h2>
		    <p> Users are able to understand the web map without a separate legend thanks to the design options available on StoryMap. A popup that was previously configured on the Web Map is also functional here. </p>
		    <img src="image/storymap1_1975_1000.png" alt="Interactive Legend" class="responsive">
		    
		    <h2 class="storymapH2"> Highlight key locations and draw the attention of the user to a specific area </h2> 
		    <p> It can be hard to follow convoluted and crowded spatial data on the map. StoryMap's slidecar function allows the publisher to draw the user's attention to a certain location. For this project, we wanted the user to focus on areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change. </h>
            	    <img src="image/storymap2_1975_1000.png" alt="focus" class="responsive">
		
		<h2 class="storymapH2"> Deploy experience builder to provide additional resources to the user </h2>
		<p> Users may want to explore the web map on their own. StoryMap can deploy other AGOL products such as <a href="experiencebuilder.html" class="storyexp">experience builder</a> to provide a more interactive experience.

		<h2 class="storymapH2">Limitations</h2>
        <p> Although we think the StoryMap is a very useful tool for this project, we did run into some limitations/challenges. We had a difficult time coming up with a concise text for the StoryMap. Choosing which data should be showcased was a tougher task than imagined. Since the strength of StoryMap comes from its ability to concisely and effectively get the main message across, we had to be very careful to keep the attention of the reader. </p>
		<h2 class="storymapH2"> Our final thought </h2>
		<p> For this particular problem statement, we think the combination of Web Map, StoryMap, and Experience Builder was the best choice. The goal of the project is to deliver key information that are outlined in the 83 page report that Metrolinx published in 2017. The StoryMap allowed us to showcase these key information in an interactive and fun way, and it also allowed us to pitch an idea to the user on how they can help with this problem. </p>
