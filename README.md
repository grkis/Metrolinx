# Metrolinx

## Idea (March 31)
### Web app builder
- Not good. What did we like? Why are we not using it (because it's using v3, decades old, ESRI will ditch it)... 
### Storymap 
- Use interactive, fluid legend using either map tour or sidecar (ex. https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8f4d3f6212624f73a99c121517d739db) 
### Experience Builder 
- An overview of the web map. For users that are interested in all the stations
