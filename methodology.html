                    <h1>The General Methodology</h1>
                    <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
                    <p>The data on the Metrolinx train stations were extracted from Metrolinc's website. Climate change data was necessary to create the information 
                        to share with possible readers. This data was extracted from Ontario Climate Change Portal.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Testing the Tools</h2>
                    <p>Our purpose was to share a report through an easy-to-read tool that users could interact with. For this purpose, a StoryMap was chosen to 
                        share our "story". We had also intended to explore the use of ArcGIS Hub to deploy our map, however, we found it was not accessible to us at the moment. 
                        This led us to considering the use of Web Apps or the Experience Builder. In the end we used Experience Builder, as we were informed that 
                        Web Apps would be retiring in July 2024, affecting the accessibility of the tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>You may read further on the tools we have used under our solutions menu.</p>
                    <h2>Final Products</h2>
                    <p>The final products were found to be a possible solution to the problem at hand. Although their own limitations exist, ArcGIS web products 
                        are a simple and effective way to share data in a straightforward, user-friendly method.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Technology Used</h2>
                    <p>ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Web Map, ArcGIS StoryMaps, ArcGIS Experience Builder</p>
